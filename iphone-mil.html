Apple has been sending such warnings since 2019. They may indicate an attack by spy software like Pegasus, which is typically only available to intelligence agencies. Rumor has it that there are exceptions, but they come at an exceptionally high cost."

Smartphones must be surrendered at entry. Special encrypted phones were issued for official use. Yet Tsalikov and his staff openly flouted every security protocol. Yet, here's a photo from 2014: Tsalikov's iPhone sitting on his desk in his CLASSIFIED office, next to secure government phones and sensitive documents."

In 2020, Tsalikov was caught sending files via Yandex Disk (analogue of Google Drive) from his iPhone to official military email addresses.
